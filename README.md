# symtype
Port of SymPy essentials to TypeScript
The goal of this project is to provide essential symbolic math functionalities to
the together.math web application. We do not intend to replicate the syntax of 
sympy in any form, and nor do we intend to replicate all of its functionalities. 
Intial work was done by William Bowers during his summer internship at together.science.
