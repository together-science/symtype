# SymType

SymType is a port of SymPy essentials to TypeScript.
The goal of this project is to provide better essential symbolic math functionality to
the together.math web application, but many JavaScript programmers have wished for a SymPy port.
We do not intend to replicate the syntax of SymPy in any form, and neither do we intend to
replicate all of its functionality, although all reasonable additions will be considered.

Initial work was done by William Bowers during his summer internship at together.science.
You can see the current state of capabilities in the [test cases](https://github.com/together-science/symtype/blob/main/ts-port/core/testing.ts).
William's notes about meta classes, mulitple inheritance and other topics are at the end of 
the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/together-science/symtype/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Contributions are welcome by PR. 

If you are looking for a fully functional, in-browser or node.js symbolic algebra system you can use TODAY, consider
